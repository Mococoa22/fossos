## Related Class: Introduction to R {.alert .alert-success}

Daniel Lemmer is offering an [introduction to R](http://univis.fau.de/form?__s=2&dsc=anew/lecture_view&lvs=phil/dsp/isoz/zentr/einfhr_4&anonymous=1&founds=phil/dsp/ipowi/zentr/argent,/spanie,///isoz/zentr/einfhr_4&sem=2018w&__e=808) (in german) as a seminar in this winter term 2018.
In this class (*fossos*), we will be using R, but we will *not* include (nor require) a full introduction to (especially base) R.
Instead, we will focus on broader open source practices and paradigms, using R as an example, but also covering recent developments in [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) R.
You do not *need* to also attend the "Introduction to R seminar"", but participation in both may give you a deeper understanding and command of a more fully-fledged stack.


## German Title {.alert .alert-info}

Depending on who will be attending the class, instruction may also occur in english or german.
In any event, all of the readings and other course material are english, and participants are expected to be proficient in reading and writing english technical documents.

Here, for the sake of completeness, is the german title:

> Open Source Werkzeuge für die wissenschaftliche Datenverarbeitung


## Course Description

Digitisation has created both new challenges and yet unrealised potentials for empirical social sciences. 
Larger, and often streamed datasets require more programmatic and dynamic statistical analyses. 
Existing commercial programs with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are expensive, and analyses can easily become intransparent, sometimes contributing to a crisis of reproducibility in the social sciences and beyond [cf. @MairThouShaltBe2016] or even propagating outright bugs [cf. @ReinhartGrowthTimeDebt2010].

Happily, the open source community has already pioneered a set of technologies and conventions for their software development efforts, that have proven useful in solving these problems in many academic fields. 
Unfortunately, learning these tools takes more time than is usually available until any given project deadline.

The goal of this seminar is therefore to train participants in a coherent set of leading tools and best practices, including:

- Separating content and presentation using plain-text formats for technical and scientific writing, including LaTeX, Pandoc Markdown and RMarkdown.
- Establishing an efficient plain-text workflow using editors and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), including Atom and RStudio.
- Introducing the world of UNIX-style command-line interface (CLI) programs and package managers, such as homebrew or APT.
- Creating programmatic statistical analyses with R, including a (cursory) introduction to R and the tidyverse.
- Learning source control management (SCM) and massively collaborative development using Git and GitHub.
- Preparing graphical summaries of data, using ggplot2.
- Preparing interactive summaries of data, shiny.
- Rendering results in a variety of formats (Word, HTML, PDF), using RMarkdown and bookdown.
- Strengthening reproducibility by applying assertions (checkmate), dependency management (packrat) and continuous integration and deployment (Travis).

Towards the end of the seminar, participants will be able to use this toolchain to work on their own projects.

```{r fig.cap="The [Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) by Drew Conway (2010)", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/Data_Science_VD.png")
```

This seminar provides a broad introduction and furnishes participants with an end-to-end consistent toolchain, but does not go into great depth of any particular tool. 
The class will also *not* focus on math and statistics knowledge or substantive sociological expertise, though both are essential for solid data science work.
Rather, the emphasis is on what Drew Conway loosely called *hacking skills* in his [Data Science Venn Diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram), that is, simply getting these tools to work together, learn how to trouble shoot them and to bring

While the class is *not* a proper computer science class, it should also be valuable to students with coding experience or a CS background who may be interested in the tooling covered. 

We will not cover the scaling and efficiency issues of proper “Big Data”, but confine ourselves to in-memory problems. 
We also limit ourselves to the R ecosystem, though some tools and problems will be similar for other programming languages such as python.

An introduction to data science and open source may well open up new job opportunities, or serve as a first stepping stone to a career with tech, but that is arguably not the only reason why social scientists should be excited about it. 
Instead, to learn the way of open source is perhaps to update the ideals of the scientific process for the modern day: radical openness and rigorous reproducibility, maximal inclusivity and promised meritocracy, generous sharing and personal attribution. 
Open source may also be a worthwhile exercise in participant observation for social scientists: here is a real, if surely flawed utopia, massively coordinating individuals beyond *both* market and state.

Less loftily, but not least, the seminar also promises a starter dose of gratification from having built something that actually works, and is of some immediate use to our fellow human – a good feeling sometimes hard to come by in the social sciences.


### Crosslistings

This is listed as upper division Bachelor seminar ("Hauptseminar") (7.5 ECTS) in:

- Bachelor Sociology
  - Sociological Methods (Module `SOZ M`, [Soziologische Methodenlehre](https://www.soziologie.phil.fau.de/institut/arbeitsbereiche/methoden-der-empirischen-sozialforschung/))
  - Labor and Organisation (Module `Soz Qf4`, [Arbeit und Organisation](https://www.soziologie.phil.fau.de/institut/arbeitsbereiche/arbeit-und-organisation/))
    (We will be using datasets from labor sociology.)
- Bachelor Digital Humanities and Social Sciences ("BA Zweitfach")
  - tba.


## Prerequisites {.alert .alert-info}

*Everyone* is welcome to this seminar.
This is *not* a "proper" computer science class, and participants do *not* need any background in CS or math.

You should just be curious and ready to:

- learn to use specialised command-line software and open-source tools for collaboration,
- read and write technical documents in simple, readable english and
- collaborate intensively using (perhaps unfamiliar) web-based tools.

No worries, we'll bring everyone up to speed in no time.


## Hardware Requirements {#reqs .alert .alert-warning}

Unfortunately, FAU has no computer lab facilities suitable for teaching this class and participants will have to **bring their own computers**.
This has the advantage that students will learn to set up their own development environments, but adds some unwelcome complexity (different OSes, etc.).

The class will assist students in installing software on their devices, but **students are responsible for maintaining their computers**.
In particular, student laptops must:

- have a reasonably current operating system (MacOS >= 10.13, Microsoft Windows >= Vista, Linux),
- have a current version of a web browser installed,
- *not* be virus-infested or in some other borked-up state,
- *not* be a mobile device (iOS or Android) (unless you can SSH into a Linux box or something),
- and have ready access to one of the WiFi networks at FAU: `FAU-STUD`, `eduroam` or `FAU.fm`. 
  (If you need help setting up your WiFi, consult the RRZE Website.)

Emphatically, none of this requires a new, powerful or expensive device, let alone software.
You can get a used laptop with / ready for Linux Ubuntu on EBay for well under €100 (if you buy a used computer, make sure that the hardware has good Linux support).
With some [tweaking](https://leanpub.com/universities/courses/jhu/cbds-chromebook), you can even use an inexpensive (x86) Google Chromebook (which kinda runs on Linux).
For more information, see [stack](/stack.html#moving_to_linux)

If you are facing financial difficulties in obtaining a laptop for the class, please contact the instructor.
We'll figure something out for you.

## Assessment {.well}

Assessments are an unfortunate, arguably needless and tedious part of teaching -- but here we are, so we are going to make the best of it.

Instead of some *make belief* work or hobby project, we are, for the most part, going to take on *real* open source projects in our assignments.
Student contributions, no matter how small, *will matter* for the people who use and maintain these projects.
However, because we do not want to burden other people with bad pull requests (more on that later), this means that we will have to meet the highest standards *before* we push our work into the open.
To ensure such a high standard, most of the public-facing "real" assignments will be preceded by some "sandbox" assignments.

Both students who wish to receive a grade *and* those who just want a "Sitzschein" pass/fail option) must submit passing work (grade >= 4) for all but 2 of both the sandbox and real assignments.
The assignments will be due *throughout the semester*.

Participants who want a grade will also have to complete a little capstone project towards the end of the class, where they make a small but meaningful contribution to an existing piece of open source software using the tools and practices learned during the semester.

Attendance is not mandatory, as per university policy.
However, students are *highly* recommended to attend the seminar regularly (no more than 2 missed sessions), and to thoroughly study the assigned material.
It is highly unlikely that you will be able to receive passing grades on the assignments otherwise.
Even though technical in nature, this class is no "rocket science", and we will get everyone up to speed, no matter the prior knowledge.
However, you have to work hard and thoroughly, otherwise it is very possible that you will simply fail the class, or receive a very low grade.

The assignments are listed below.
They are always due on Fridays, 20:00 CET *after* the session in which they are introduced.
You will receive your grades before the following Monday, 20:00 CET.


## Flipped Classroom


## No Papers or Books to Read


## Schedule and Material

There are a *lot* of great resources for learning data science tools out there, many of them free, some of them even open source themselves.
The good news is that we can reuse a lot of these resources, and I (the instructor) do not have to reinvent an (inferior) wheel.
The (slighly) bad news is that there is no *one* curriculum that's quite right for us, so we have to cobble together material from different sources, all listed in the below.

The material is all online, we do not need anything on paper for this class.
